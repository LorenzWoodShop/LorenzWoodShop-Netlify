  to start over again.

## But why?

Well the short story is I switched to wordpress + enfold + pantheon, while this is a usually great go to, I found that if you're trying to use Pantheon for free you experience TONS of downtime. Github and Netlify don't seem to have this issue so I'm switching to that!

## Takes a little time.

It'll take me a little bit to get restarted but if you need to contact me for anything you can email me at LorenzWoodshop@gmail.com where I prefer all communications to come through.
